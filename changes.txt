1. Model Architecture
    -- using tanh activations instead of relu
    -- reducing parameters from 2,887,299 (11.01 MB) to Total params: 286,147 (1.09 MB)

2. Data
    -- added extra very_low recordings

3. training:
    -- added reduce learning rate on plateau call back
    -- added 20 epochs to get to 40 epochs total

4. Results
    -- accuracy: 0.969
    -- Precision: 0.9710
    -- Recall:    0.9695
    --AUC:       0.9989

5. Notes
    model is sensitive to wind if we can remove lower frequencies below around 800 we could eliminate this problem for low wind
    this depends on the multi-class larvae classifier
